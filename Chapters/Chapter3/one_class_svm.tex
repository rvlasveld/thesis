\section{One-Class Support Vector Machine}\label{sec:one_class_svm}


%--------------------------------------------
\subsection{Support Vector Machine}\label{subsec:svm}
We will first discuss the traditional two-class \gls{svm} before we consider the one-class variant, as introduced by Cortes and Vapnik in \cite{cortes1995support}.
Consider a data set $\Omega = \{ (x_1, y_1),\allowbreak (x_2, y_2), \dots , (x_n, y_n) \}$; points $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ in a (for instance two-dimensional) space where $x_i$ is the $i$-th input data point and $y_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ is the $i$-th output pattern, indicating the class membership.

A \gls{svm} can create a boundary between linear-separable data points, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.
More flexible non-linear boundaries can be obtained by the use of a non-linear function $\phi(x)$, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:kernel_mapping}.
This function maps the input data from space $\mathcal{I}$ to a higher dimensional space $\mathcal{F}$.
The \gls{svm} can create a linear separating hyperplane in the space $\mathcal{F}$ that separates the data points from the two classes.
When the hyperplane is projected to the (lower) original input space $\mathcal{I}$ it creates a non-linear separating curve.
The mapping and projection of data points can be efficient (and implicit) performed by using the kernel trick, which is discussed in section \ref{subsec:kernel_trick}.

The separating hyperplane is represented by
\begin{equation}
w^T x + b = 0,
\end{equation}
with $w \in F$ and $b \in R$.
The hyperplane that is created determines the \emph{margin} between the classes; the minimal distance from one of the data points to the hyperplane.
In geometric sense, $w$ is the normal vector to the hyperplane and $\frac{b}{\lVert{w}\rVert}$ determines the offset of the hyperplane to the origin.
Since the distance between the two margins is equal to $\frac{2}{\lVert{w}\rVert}$, the maximum-margin hyperplane is found by minimizing $\lVert{w}\rVert$.
The data points which lie on the margin are the \emph{support vectors}.
This geometrical interpretation is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:svm_hyperplane}.
All data points for which $y_i = -1$ are on one side of the hyperplane and all other data points (for which $y_i = 1$) are on the other side.
The minimal distance from a data point to the hyperplane is for both classes equal.
This results in a \emph{maximal margin} between the two classes.
Thus, the \gls{svm} searches for a maximal separating hyperplane.

With every classification method there is a risk of overfitting.
In that case the random error or noise of the data set is described instead of the underlying data.
The \gls{svm} classifier can use a \emph{soft margin} by allowing some data points to lie within the margin, instead of on the margin or farther away from the hyperplane.
For this it introduces \emph{slack variables} $\xi_i$ for each data point and the constant $C > 0$ the determines the trade-off between maximizing the margin and the number of data points within that margin (and thus the training errors).
The objective function for a \gls{svm} is the following minimization function:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:svm_objective}
  \operatorname*{min}_{w,\ b,\ \xi_i} \frac{ \lVert{w}\rVert^2 }{2} + C \sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{multlined}
  \mbox{ subject to: } \\*
  \begin{aligned}
  y_i( w^T \phi(x_i) + b) \geq & 1 - \xi_i & \mbox{ for all } i = 1, \dots, n \\*
   & \xi_i \geq 0 & \mbox{ for all } i = 1, \dots, n\\*
  \end{aligned}
  \end{multlined}
\end{equation}

*** TODO: better format of above formula ***

This minimization problem can be solved (using \gls{qp}) and transformed to its Lagrange dual formulation.
To do so, the Lagrange multipliers $a_i >= 0$ are introduced and the decision function becomes:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:svm_lagrange}
  f(x) = \operatorname{sgn}( \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i K(x, x_i) + b),
\end{equation}
where $K(x, x_i) = \phi(x)^T\phi(x_i)$ (which is further discussed in section \ref{subsec:kernel_trick}).
Here every data point $\mathcal{I}$ for which $a_i > 0$ is weighted in the decision function and thus ``supports'' the classification machine: hence the name ``\acrlong{svm}''.
Since it is shown that under certain circumstances \glspl{svm} show an equality to sparse representations \cite{girosi1998equivalence,smola1998connection}, there will often be relatively few Lagrange multipliers with a non-zero value.


%--------------------------------------------

\subsection{Kernel trick}\label{subsec:kernel_trick}
In the previous section, \ref{subsec:svm}, the mapping function $\phi(x)$ and the kernel function $K$ were briefly mentioned.
The decision function in equation \ref{eq:svm_lagrange} only relies on the dot-products of mapped data points in the feature space $\mathcal{F}$ (\ie all pairwise distances between the data points in that space).
It shows \cite{flach2012machine} that as long as any function has the same result, without an explicit mapping to the higher dimension $\mathcal{F}$, the dot-products can be substituted by the kernel function $K$.
This is known as the \emph{kernel trick} and gives the \gls{svm} the ability to create non-linear decision function without high computational complexity.
This mapping is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:kernel_mapping}.
Here the non-linear separating boundary in the input space $\mathcal{I}$ is mapped, via $\phi$, to a linear boundary in the feature space $\mathcal{F}$.

The kernel function $K$ can have different forms, such as linear, polynomial and sigmoidal but the most used (and flexible) form is the Gaussian \gls{rbf}.
As Smola \etal \cite{smola1998connection} state, this Gaussian kernel yields good performance, especially when no assumptions can be made about the data.
The kernel maps input space $\mathcal{I}$ to the feature space $\mathcal{F}$ which is a Hilbert Space of infinite dimensions *** ref needed ***:
\begin{equation}
  K(x, x') = \operatorname{exp} \left( - \frac{ \lVert x - x' \rVert ^2}{2 \sigma^2 } \right),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma \in R$ is a kernel parameter and $\lVert x - x' \rVert$ is the dissimilarity measure expressed in Euclidean distance.

\subsection{Reproducing kernel Hilbert space}
\emph{Write something on this topic? Or leave it implicit?}


%--------------------------------------------

\subsection{One-Class Support Vector Machines}\label{subsec:one-class-svm}
The classical implementation of a \gls{svm} is to classify a dataset in two distinct classes.
This is a common usecase, although sometimes there is no training data for both classes available.
Still, one would like to classify new data points as regular, or in-class, or out-of-class, \eg in the case of a novelty detection.
With that problem only data from one class is available and the objective is to recognize new data points that are not part of that class.
This problem is closely related to density estimation.
In that context, the problem can be the following.
Given an underlying probabilty distribution $P$ the goal is to find a subset $S$ for which the probability that a data point from $P$ lies outside $S$ equals some predetermined value $\nu$ between $0$ and $1$ \cite{scholkopf1999support}.

We will discuss two implementations of \glspl{oc-svm}.
The first is the \gls{nu-svm} by Sch\"olkopf \etal \cite{scholkopf1999support} and closely follows the above problem statement regarding density estimation.
The second, on which we will base our change detection method, is the \gls{svdd} by Tax and Duin \cite{tax2004support}.

%--------------------------------------------

\subsection{\acrlong{nu-svm}}\label{subsec:nu-svm}
The first of the \gls{oc-svm} methods we will discuss is often referred to as \gls{nu-svm} and introduced by Sch\"olkopf \etal \cite{scholkopf1999support}.
Instead of estimating the density function of an distribution $P$, it focuses on an easier problem: the algorithm find regions in the input where the ``probability density lives''.
This results in a function such that most of the data is in the region where the function is nonzero.

The constructed decision function $\mathcal{F}$ resembles the function discussed in Section \ref{subsec:svm}.
It returns the value $+1$ in a (possibly small) region capturing most of the data points, and $-1$ elsewhere.
The method maps the data points from input space $\mathcal{I}$ to a feature space $\mathcal{F}$ (following classical \glspl{svm}).
In that space $\mathcal{F}$ it separates the data points with maximal margin from the origin, with a hyperplane.
For a new data points $x$, the function value $f(x)$ determines wheter the data point is part of the distribution (\ie the value is $+1$) or a novelty (\ie the value is $-1$).
The hyperplane is represented by $g(x) = w \cdot \phi(x) + \rho = 0$ and the decision function is $f(x) = \operatorname{sgn}(g(x))$.
This hyperplane and the separation from the origin is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:nu-svm}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{./Figures/chapter3/nu-svm.pdf}
  \caption[\gls{nu-svm}]{Graphical representation of \gls{nu-svm}. The separating hyperplane $w \cdot \phi(x_i) + \rho = 0$ create a maximal margin, in the feature space, between the data points and the origin. Slack variables $\xi_i$ are used to create a soft margin.}
  \label{fig:nu-svm}
\end{figure}

The objective function to find the separating hyperplane is the following minimization function, which can be solved using \gls{qp}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:nu-svm_objective}
  \operatorname*{min}_{w,\ \xi_i,\ \rho } \frac{\lVert w \rVert ^2}{2} + \frac{1}{\nu n} \sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i - \rho
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{multlined}
    \mbox{ subject to: } \\
    \begin{aligned}
      (w \cdot \phi(x_i)) \geq & \rho - \xi_i & \mbox{ for all } i = 1, \dots, n \\
      & \xi_i \geq 0 & \mbox{ for all } i = 1, \dots, n \\
    \end{aligned}
  \end{multlined}
\end{equation}

The decision function in the dual formulation with Lagrange multipliers is denoted as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nu-svm_lagrange}
f(x) = \operatorname{sgn}((w \cdot \phi(x_i)) - \rho) = \operatorname{sgn}( \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i K(x, x_i) - \rho)
\end{equation}

In the classical \gls{svm} objective function, as denoted in Equation \ref{eq:svm_objective}, the parameter $C$ decided the smoothness of the boundary, with respect to the slack variables $\xi_i$.
In the formulation of \gls{nu-svm} the equivalent parameter is $\nu \in (0,1)$ (hence the name).
It characterizes the solution in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\nu$ is an upper bound on the fraction of outliers, \ie training examples regarded as out-of-class.
  \item $\nu$ is a lower bound on the fraction of \glspl{sv}, \ie training examples with a nonzero Lagrange multiplier $\alpha_i$.
\end{enumerate}
When $\nu$ approaches $0$, the penalty factor for nonzero Lagrange multipliers ($\frac{1}{\nu n}$) becomes infinite, and thus the solution resembles a \emph{hard margin} boundary.

This method creates a \emph{hyperplane}, characterized by $w$ and $\rho$, that separates the data with maximal margin from the origin in the feature space $\mathcal{F}$.
In the following section we will discuss an alternative method, which uses an circumscribing \emph{hypersphere} to characterize the data (and the region of distribution $P$ where the density (or: support) lives).


%--------------------------------------------

\subsection{\acrlong{svdd}}\label{subsec:oc-svm-svdd}
The method introduced by Tax and Duin \cite{tax2004support}, known as \acrlong{svdd}, takes as spherical instead of planar approach.
The boundary, created in feature space $\mathcal{F}$, forms a hypersphere around the (high density region of the) data.
The volume of this hypersphere is minimized to get the smallest enclosing boundary.
By allowing outliers using slacks variables, in the same manner as classical \gls{svm} and \gls{nu-svm}, a soft margin is constructed.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{./Figures/chapter3/nu-vs-svdd.pdf}
  \caption[Difference \gls{nu-svm} and \gls{svdd}]{Graphical representation of the difference between \gls{nu-svm} (left) and \gls{svdd} (right). Note that for the sake of simplicity the kernel functions are not applied.}
  \label{fig:nu-vs-svdd}
\end{figure}

The constructed hypersphere is characterized by a center $\mathbf{a}$ and a radius $R > 0$ as distance from the center to (any data point that is a \gls{sv} on) the boundary, for which the volume, and thus the radius $R$, will be minimized.
The center $\mathbf{a}$ is a linear combination of of the support vectors.
Like the classical \gls{svm} and \gls{svdd} it can be required that all the distances from the data points $x_i$ to the center $\mathbf{a}$ are strict less then $R$ (or equivalent measure, to create a hard margin) or soft margins are allowed by using slack variables $\xi_i$.
In the case of a soft margin, the penalty is determined by $C$ and the minimization is expressed as Equation \ref{eq:svdd_objective}.
This principle is illustrated in the right image or Figure \ref{fig:nu-vs-svdd}.
Instead of a separating hyperplane, constructed by \gls{nu-svm} and illustrated on the left of the Figure, the \gls{svdd} creates a hypersphere (in the illustration a cricle) around the data points.
By using kernel functions (\eg the \gls{rbf}) the hyperspheres in the high dimensional feature space $\mathcal{F}$ corresponds to a flexible and tight enclosing boundary in input space $\mathcal{I}$, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:svdd-boundary}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:svdd_objective}
  \operatorname*{min}_{R,\ \mathbf{a} } R^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{multlined}
    \mbox{ subject to: } \\
    \begin{aligned}
      \lVert x_i - \mathbf{a} \rVert ^ 2 \leq & R^2 + \xi_i & \mbox{ for all } i = 1, \dots, n \\
      & \xi_i \geq 0 & \mbox{ for all } i = 1, \dots, n \\
    \end{aligned}
  \end{multlined}
\end{equation}

The dual formulation, by using Lagrange multipliers $\alpha_i$, can be used to test a new data point $z$ and is the following:

\begin{equation}
  \lVert z - \mathbf{x} \rVert ^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \operatorname{exp} \left( \frac{- \lVert z - x_i \rVert ^ 2}{\sigma^2} \right) \geq -R^2/2 + C_R
\end{equation}

  \item Explain RKHS? (Hilbert Space)
\end{itemize}

$k(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x})$ is a kernel function computing a dot product in feature space, introduced by Aizerman \etal \cite{aizerman1964theoretical}.
``Training a \gls{svm} with Gaussian \gls{rbf} kernels corresponds to minimizing the specific cost function with a regularization operator'' \cite{smola1998connection}. \\
``Gaussian kernels tend to yield good performance under general smoothness assumptions and should be considered especially of no additional knowledge of the data is available.'' \cite{smola1998connection}. \\
``Choosing a small width of the kernels leads to high generalization error as it effectively decouples the separate basis functions of the kernel expansion into very localized functions which is equivalent to memorizing the data, whereas a wide kernel tends to oversmooth.'' \cite{smola1998connection}. \\
